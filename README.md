**Assign 02 - Rabbits**

**Date assigned:**

**Program due:**

**Points:**

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Write a complete program that uses loops to solve a simulation.

2.  Error check user input.

3.  Test edge cases for the simulation

The problem to solve can be found at: <a href="https://rosalind.info/problems/fib/">Rabbits and Recurrence Relations</a>

Here is exactly what your program interaction is to look like with user input in **bold**:

<pre>
*** Fibonacci Simulation *** 

Enter End Month: 5
Enter Rabbit Pairs Produced: 3
After Month: 5 Number Of Rabbit Pairs Is: 19

</pre>

Note1: Do not use any concepts after Week #4

Note2: Keep track of how much time it takes you to: 1) understand the problem including Figure 1 and 2) code up a solution to the problem

Note3: You are to come in and explain Figure 1 to me in person

Note4: Keep asking for user input until the user enters a legal value

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Assign02 Link to accept this
        assignment. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic copy of your program (punetidAssign02Rabbits.pdf) is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
